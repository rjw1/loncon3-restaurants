summary: A dual menu offers Northern Chinese specialities as well as the usual standard Anglicised Chinese food. Much of the specialities menu is written in Chinese-only, but a fair selection of it is translated and illustrated, and staff are happy to help with recommendations from the rest. Hotpot (steamboat) is also available, with a wide range of ingredients. Decor and furnishings are fairly basic, but not uncomfortable.
access: A rudimentary ramp (really just a smoothed-over step) from the pavement to the area directly outside the door, and another shallow step to get in. It's all essentially on one level once you're in, though there is a slight change in level (not really enough to call it a step) on the way to the loos.

summary: Cosy locals' pub serving Young's ales, guest ales from London breweries, and American craft beers. A short and focused menu offers traditional pub food such as fish and chips, sausage and mash, and home-made pheasant pie. Vegetarian options are scarce. Large beer garden at the back.
access: No steps at entrances, but steps down to the toilets from both bars. I think there was at least one step to the beer garden.

summary: The brewery tap for Greenwich's Meantime Brewery, offering the full range of their beers. Beer garden at the back. Full a la carte menu plus sandwiches, more interesting than your average pub menu. Bar snacks might include calamari with wild garlic and squid ink alioli, or “pigs in blankets” (sausages wrapped in bacon),
access: No steps to enter, and the bar and garden are on the same level, but the toilets are down a flight of stairs.

summary: Hidden away down a narrow pedestrian alleyway, this pub and restaurant consists of a pair of late 17th century houses, converted to a chop-house and coffee shop in the 18th century.
access: At least one step to get into the ground-floor dining room and bar. The restaurant and wine bar involve steep staircases. The ground floor passages are narrow and twisty, and the interior is very cramped.

summary: Modern-style teashop offering a full range of loose-leaf teas, espresso-based coffees, handmade cakes including wheat-free options, sandwiches, and daily hot options.
access: No step to get in (just a small ridge), and it's step-free through to the toilet too. The interior is quite well-filled with chairs and tables, and it might be hard to get a wheelchair to a table if the place was full. The toilet is a single cubicle and isn't overly large, but the door opens outwards.
