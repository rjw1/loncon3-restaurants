summary: Cantonese restaurant with a view over the Royal Docks and London City Airport; good for dim sum in large groups, particularly with children who enjoy the views of the planes.

Restaurant is on an upper floor but there's a lift. Toilets on same level as restaurant, with no intervening steps (including an accessible one that doubles as a baby-change room).
