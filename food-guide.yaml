summary: Independent bar and restaurant with a wood-fired pizza oven. Breads, patisserie, and savouries also baked in-house. Lagers and ciders on tap, and it's fine to visit for just a drink.
access: Step-free to get in, no internal steps, accessible toilet. Noise levels can get high at peak times.

summary: A dual menu offers Northern Chinese specialities as well as the usual standard Anglicised Chinese food. Much of the specialities menu is written in Chinese-only, but a fair selection of it is translated and illustrated, and staff are happy to help with recommendations from the rest. Hotpot (steamboat) is also available, with a wide range of ingredients. Decor and furnishings are fairly basic, but not uncomfortable.
access: A rudimentary ramp (really just a smoothed-over step) from the pavement to the area directly outside the door, and another shallow step to get in. It's all essentially on one level once you're in, though there is a slight change in level (not really enough to call it a step) on the way to the loos.

summary: Cosy locals' pub serving Young's ales, guest ales from London breweries, and American craft beers. A short and focused menu offers traditional pub food such as fish and chips, sausage and mash, and home-made pheasant pie. Vegetarian options are scarce. Large beer garden at the back.
access: No steps at entrances, but steps down to the toilets from both bars. I think there was at least one step to the beer garden.

summary: The brewery tap for Greenwich's Meantime Brewery, offering the full range of their beers. Beer garden at the back. Full a la carte menu plus sandwiches, more interesting than your average pub menu. Bar snacks might include calamari with wild garlic and squid ink alioli, or “pigs in blankets” (sausages wrapped in bacon),
access: No steps to enter, and the bar and garden are on the same level, but the toilets are down a flight of stairs.

summary: Pub, restaurant and hotel owned by well-known London brewery Fuller's. Nine handpumps for real ale, and food a little pricier but also more elaborate than usual for a pub. Separate children's menu.
access: Two or three steps to get in, depending on which entrance you use. Once you're in, it's step-free to the bar, the restaurant area, and some of the seating in the bar area. Much of the bar-area seating is on high tables with high benches. About half of the normal-height seating is up one step on a dais. The toilets (including an accessible one) are in the basement, down a flight of stairs with three bends and a sturdy rail on one side; there is a lift that goes down here too.
